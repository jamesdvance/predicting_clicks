# Predicting Clicks
### A survey of different click-prediction datasets with various ml methods

Predicting clicks is hugely important to today's web. Anything personalized such as recommendations, search results or dynamic ads can be driven with a click-prediction model. Still its not a simple problem to crack. The relative quality of the model is not trivial. Over millions of impressions a company has a lot to gain from a slight improvement in their probability of click prediction. 

With that in mind, let's explore the datasets in this survey.
